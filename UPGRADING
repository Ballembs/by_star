Upgrading to ByStar 2.2.0
-------------------------

* For Mongoid only, ByStar's `.between` method has been removed and replaced with `.between_times`
(previously `.between_times` was an alias to `.between`). Mongoid already provides a native `.between`
finder method that we do not want to mask. ActiveRecord users may continue to use either method.

* Chronic gem (used for time string parsing) has been removed as a hard dependency for ByStar,
however it is still supported. If you would like to use Chronic with ByStar, please explicitly
include `gem chronic` into your Gemfile.
